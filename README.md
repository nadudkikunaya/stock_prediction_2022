# What is this?
It's just a uni's small group work in Data Warehouse and Data Mining course.
In this course, we've learn how to use Tableau, RapidMiner, and pandas.
This project is a workshop to learn creating a prediction model by **training data with label** and **creating a desicion tree**.

# Training set & Test set
We chose to train a stock prediction model by using **data from 2014-2017 as training set** and **data from 2018 as test set**.
These data was downloaded from Kaggle.
